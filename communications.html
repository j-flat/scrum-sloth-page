  <h1>Communications</h1>

  <h2>Facts</h2>
  <p>
  When I think of a sloth, I think about it being slow, lethargic and silent. Why I associate silence with a sloth is probably because I envision it creeping slowly through the tree tops and then stopping to take a long rest. An animal that's so slow brings to mind silence, kind of like a turtle. Bottom line: I just don't think of a sloth as a noisy being.

  Well, it turns out that they do make sounds. The babies make bleating type sounds if they become separated from their parent. (Hey, it's a jungle out there and those little guys have to have a way to let mom know where they are!) Once I think about it, it would be pretty sad if the babies didn't have a way to alert their parent. So, being able to make a sound makes sense.

  <h2>Communication with other sloths</h2>
  <p>
    Adults, at least the three-toed sloth variety,  can actually make long, high-pitched sounds that echo through the trees. Why they do this, I don't know. Perhaps its how they communicate with their sloth community? Or maybe they just like to hear themselves cry out.

  <h2>Communication with other species</h2>
  <p>
    Sloths communicate to other species using morse code.
